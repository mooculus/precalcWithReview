\section{Introduction}
%
Here are some questions you should be able to answer. 
\begin{itemize}
\item What is a function?
\item What are some properties that all functions share?
\item What are the domain and range of a function, and how can they be calculated?
\item What are zeros of functions, and how can they be found? 
\item How can functions be built out of other functions? 
\item Which functions have inverses, and how can they be found?
\item What kinds of symmetries can the graphs of functions show?
\item What are some famous kinds of functions? What do their graphs look like? Why are they important? What do they model?
\item How can we describe the average rate of change of a function?
\item How can we go back and forth between different representations of a function?
\end{itemize}
