For the following word problems, determine what type of function is needed to solve them (e.g., linear, quadratic, cubic, logarithmic, exponential, etc.) and give the function.

\item Suppose you invest \$2000 in an account which offers 7.125\% compounded monthly. Without adding to your initial investment, you want to know how much will be in the account after $t$ years. 

What type of equation would be needed to solve this?\\
\wordChoice{\choice{linear}\choice{quadratic}\choice{cubic}\choice{logarithmic}\choice[correct]{exponential}}.
\begin{exercise}
Compound interest can be represented by the function
$$A(t) = P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt},$$
where $P$ is the principal invested at an annual rate $r$, and the interest is compounded $n$ times per year. Then $A(t)$ represents the amount in the account after
%
\wordChoice{\choice{n \ months}\choice{t \ months}\choice{n \ years}\choice[correct]{t \ years}}.

\begin{exercise}
Express the amount in the account $A$ as a function of the term of the investment in $t$ years.\\
$A(t) = \answer{2000}(\answer{1}+ \answer{\frac{0.07125}{12}})^{\answer{12t}}$
