  A group of biologists, studying a certain culture of bacteria, has established that under ideal conditions, the population of bacteria may be found with the expression $N(t) = 2000\cdot 2^{0.5t}$, with $t$ in hours. How long after the beginning of the observations will the population of bacteria be of $8,192,000$?

  Answer: $\answer{24}$ hours.
