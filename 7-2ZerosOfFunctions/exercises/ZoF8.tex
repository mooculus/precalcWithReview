\begin{exercise}
A ball is thrown straight upward from the ground.  The distance the ball is from the ground is given by the function $f(x)=9-(x-3)^2$ where $x$ is the time measured in seconds and $f(x)$ is the distance from the ground measured in feet.  What time will the ball hit the ground?

The ball will hit the ground at time $t = \answer{6}$ seconds.
