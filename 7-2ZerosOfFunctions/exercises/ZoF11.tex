Rowan has been driving at 60 miles per hour. In a horrible coincidence, their car has run out of gas, and the brakes have stopped working. Thankfully, they're driving on a completely straight country road with no other vehicles in sight. 

The speed of Rowan's car is given by a function $v$ defined by $v(t) = 60 - \frac{t^2}{960}$, where $t$ is in seconds. At what time (in seconds) will Rowan's car stop?
