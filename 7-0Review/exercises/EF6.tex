\begin{document}

  A population has $5000$ people at time $t=0$, where $t$ is measured in years.

  \begin{exercise}
    If the population increases by $200$ people by year, the population $P(t)$ after $t$ years equals $P(t) = \answer{5000+200t}$.
  \end{exercise}


  \begin{exercise}
      If the population increases by $7\%$ by year, the population $P(t)$ after $t$ years equals $P(t) = \answer{5000(1.07)^t}$.
  \end{exercise}
