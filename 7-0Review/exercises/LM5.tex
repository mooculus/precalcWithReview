A shoe salesperson is paid \$250 per week plus 3\% commission on her weekly sales of $x$ dollars.


\begin{enumerate}
\item A linear function that represents her total weekly pay, $W$ (in dollars) in terms of $x$ is $W(x) = \answer{.03x + 250}$.

\item In order for her to earn \$445 for the week, her weekly sales must be \$$\answer{6500}$.

\item The drapery department at her store has an open sales position that only pays \$200 per week, but pays out 5\% commission on sales. What is the minimum amount of sales she would have to sell in a week to make more money at the drapery sales job than the shoe sales job? \$$\answer{2500}$
