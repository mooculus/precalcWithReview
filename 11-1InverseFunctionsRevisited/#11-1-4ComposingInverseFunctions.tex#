There's a general phenomenon which sometimes makes things simpler. To understand it, let's go back to the underpinning idea of what is the inverse function $f^{-1}$'s job: to undo what $f$ does.  So, if we have two one-to-one functions $f$ and $g$ for which the composition $g\circ f$ makes sense, then $g\circ f$ should also be one-to-one. In other words, the composition of two ``reversible'' processes must also be ``reversible''. The next question, then, is what should be the inverse of the full composition $g\circ f$. Since $g\circ f$ first applies $f$, and then $g$, reversing it should be done on the opposite order of things, first applying $g^{-1}$, and then $f^{-1}$.

\begin{callout}
  {\bf Theorem:} The composition of two one-to-one functions $f$ and $g$, whenever it makes sense, is also one-to-one, and the relation $$(g\circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$$ holds. More generally, the composition of any number of one-to-one functions is one-to-one, and the inverse of the composition is the composition of the inverses, \emph{but in the reverse order}.
\end{callout}

In practice, this result can be used to quickly find formulas for inverse function, provided one is able to express (or reverse engineer) the given function as a composition of simpler functions whose inverses are known. Properly applied, this also allows us to bypass the verification that the given function is one-to-one (again, if the simpler functions are more well-known to be one-to-one). 

Let's revisit an example from the last section as an application of this:

\begin{example}
  Consider again the function given by $h(x) = e^{\sqrt{x-3}}$, for all $x\geq 3$, on Example 3. What does $h$ do to a number $x$? First, subtract $3$. Secondly, take the square root. Lastly, exponentiates it. Writing it mathematically, we have that $h = h_1\circ h_2\circ h_3$, where $$h_1(x) =e^x,\quad h_2(x) = \sqrt{x},\quad\mbox{and}\quad h_3(x)= x-3.$$All of those functions are one-to-one, with inverses given by $$h_1^{-1}(x) = \ln x,\quad h_2^{-1}(x) = x^2,\quad\mbox{and}\quad h_3^{-1}(x) = x+3.$$Hence \begin{align*}h^{-1}(x) &= (h_1\circ h_2\circ h_3)^{-1}(x) \\ &= h_3^{-1}\circ h_2^{-1} \circ h_1^{-1}(x) \\ &= h_3^{-1}\circ h_2^{-1}(\ln x) \\ &= h_3^{-1}((\ln x)^2) \\ &= (\ln x)^2 + 3, \end{align*}which agrees with what was obtained before.
\end{example}
