\begin{enumerate}
\item If the graph of an invertible function $f$ contains the point $(8, -9)$, then the graph of $f^{-1}$ contains the point $(\answer{-9}, \answer{8})$. 

\item If a linear function $f$ has slope $-3$, the function $f^{-1}$ has slope $\answer{-\frac{1}{3}}$.

\item If the graph of a linear function $f$ with slope $5$ has its $y$-intercept at $(0, 7)$, the graph of $f^{-1}$ has its $y$-intercept at $\left(\answer{0}, \answer{-\frac{7}{5}}\right)$.

\item If $f$ is an invertible function, then $f$ has at most $\answer{1}$ zero(s). 

\item If an invertible function $f$ has a zero at $x = -2$, then the graph of $f^{-1}$ has its $y$-intercept at $(\answer{0}, \answer{-2})$.
