\begin{document}
Keith is selling minatures of carousel horses that he has hand carved and painted at local fairs and art shows.  He originally sells the horses for \$40 each.  
\begin{exercise}
He sells more than he can make, so he raises the price by 25\%.  What is the new price of the horses?  $40(1+\answer{.25})=\answer{50}$
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
He is not selling many horses, so he puts them on sale for 15\% off.  What is the new price of the horses after he both raises and then lowers the price?  $\answer{50}(1-\answer{.15})=\answer{42.50}$.  
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
The final price of the horses after he both raises and lowers the price is $\answer{(1.25)(.85)(100)}$\% of the original price of the horses.
\end{exercise}
