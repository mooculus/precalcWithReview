\begin{exercise}

 Imagine that a certain population, in danger of becoming extinct, decreases by $12\%$ per week. Knowing that the original population was of $960$, fill the following table (\textbf{rounding results up to the next integer}, before proceeding to the next month):

  $$
\begin{array}{cc}
\text{Week } t& \text{Population}\\
\hline
0 & 960 \\
1& \answer{845}\\
2& \answer{744}\\
3& \answer{655}\\
4&\answer{577}
\end{array}
$$

\begin{exercise}
  If the population $P$ were a \emph{linear} function $P(t) = mt+n$ of the week $t$, based on the first two values of the above table, what would be the coefficients $m$ and $n$? Answer: $P(t) = \answer{-115}t+\answer{960}$.

  \begin{exercise}
    Is $P(3)$ equal to $655$? Based on your answer, is a linear model the most adequate for this situation?
