\begin{exercise}
A particular car is known to have a fuel efficiency of $32$ miles/gallon (mpg).


\begin{enumerate}
	\item If this car is driven $32$ miles, it uses $\answer{1}$ gallons of fuel.

	\item If this car is driven $96$ miles, it uses $\answer{3}$ gallons of fuel.

	\item Call $x$ the number of miles driven and $y$ the gallons of fuel used. Then $x$ and $y$ have a linear relationship.
	
		\begin{enumerate}

			\item The slope of this linear relationship is $\answer{1/32}$ gallons/mile.

			\item The equation of this line in slope-intercept form is given by $y = \answer{(1/32)*x + 0}$.

		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
