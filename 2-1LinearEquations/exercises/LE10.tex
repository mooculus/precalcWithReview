\begin{exercise}
Consider a line whose equation in point-slope form is $(y - 1) = 3(x - 2)$. 

In slope-intercept form, its equation is $y = \answer{3}x + \answer{-5}$. 

In standard form, its equation is $\answer{-3}x + y = \answer{-5}$.

In intercept form, its equation is $\frac{x}{\answer{5/3}} + \frac{y}{\answer{-5}} = 1$.
