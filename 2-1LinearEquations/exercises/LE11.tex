\begin{exercise}
Consider a line whose equation in slope-intercept form is $y = -2x + 5$. 

In point-slope form, its equation is $(y - \answer{7}) = -2(x + 1)$. 

In standard form, its equation is $\answer{2}x + y = \answer{5}$.

In intercept form, its equation is $\frac{x}{\answer{5/2}} + \frac{y}{\answer{5}} = 1$.
