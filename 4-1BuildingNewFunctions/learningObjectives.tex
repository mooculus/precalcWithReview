\begin{objectives}

\item Algebra of Functions
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions 
	\item Think of complicated functions as objects in their own right 
	\item Evaluate complicated functions 
	\item Break more complicated functions into famous function %(prep for product and quotient rule) 
	\item Understand functions via graphs, tables, algebraically, and abstractly 
\end{itemize}


\item Composition
\begin{itemize}
	\item Compose two functions
	\item See how composition can be used in context
	\item Understand finding average rate of change as involving composition

\end{itemize}
