\begin{exercise}
The graph below shows the fuel consumption (in miles per gallon, mpg) of a car driving at various speeds (in miles per hour, mph).

\begin{image}
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{ChangingInTandemFigure1.png}
\end{image}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How much gas is used on a 400 mile trip at 80 mph?  \\
amount of gas = $\answer[tolerance=.75]{400/24}$ gallons

\begin{hint}
When the car is going 80 mph, it appears from the graph that the fuel consumption is approximately 24 mpg.
\end{hint}

\item How much gas is saved by traveling 60 mph instead of 70 mph on a 600 mile trip?  \\
saved gas = $\answer[tolerance=.8]{-600/30+600/27}$ gallons
%how do I add an interval of fudge factor?

\item According to this graph, what is the most fuel efficient speed to travel? \\
most fuel efficient speed=$\answer[tolerance=2]{55}$ mph
%how do I add an interval of fudge factor?
