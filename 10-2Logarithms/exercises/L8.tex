The equation $5^x = 3^{x - 3}$ has $\answer{1}$ solution(s).

\begin{exercise}
The solution to $5^x = 3^{x - 3}$ is $\answer{\frac{-3\ln(3)}{\ln(5) - \ln(3)}}$.

Note: Answers have to be in terms of natural log or log base 10 to be understood by Ximera. If your answer contains another log base, use the change-of-base formula to change it to natural log or log base 10.
