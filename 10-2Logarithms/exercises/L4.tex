Cameron dislikes logarithms and always tries to get rid of as many as possible. Whenever they see an expression like 
$$
\log_2(y) + \log_2(z) - \log_2(w),
$$
they use the product property of logarithms to rewrite it as 
$$
\log_2\left(\frac{yz}{w}\right). 
$$
Cameron is satisfied because now, there's only one logarithm in the expression.

\begin{exercise}
For each expression below, write it as an expression involving only one logarithm with coefficient 1.  

Note: Answers have to be in terms of natural log or log base 10 to be understood by Ximera.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
$$
7\ln(wz) = \ln(\answer{w^7z^7})
$$

\item 
$$
2\log(j) - \log(k) = \log\left(\answer{\frac{j^2}{k}}\right)
$$

\item
$$
2\log(y) + \log(y^2) = \log(\answer{y^4})
$$

\item 
$$
2\ln(x) - \ln(w) + \frac{1}{2}\ln(z) = \ln\left(\answer{\frac{x^2z^{1/2}}{w}}\right)
$$



\item 
$$
\log_3(x^2) + 2\left(\log_3(xz) - \frac{1}{3}\log_3(yz)\right) = \log_3\left(\answer{\frac{x^4z^{4/3}}{y^{2/3}}}\right)
$$


\end{enumerate}
