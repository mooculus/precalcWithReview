\begin{exercise}
Solve the equation $\cos(t) = \frac{5}{6}$. 

One solution, found by applying $\arccos$ to both sides of the equation, is given by $\answer{\arccos\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)}$ and lies in Quadrant $\answer{I}$ (give your answer as a Roman numeral). 

\begin{exercise}
Since cosine has period $2\pi$, one period of cosine is given by $[-\pi, \answer{\pi}]$. Since $\cos(t) > 0$, the other solution on this period has to lie in
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Quadrant I.}
\choice{Quadrant II.}
\choice{Quadrant III.}
\choice[correct]{Quadrant IV.}
\choice{There is no other solution on this period.}
\end{multipleChoice} 
\begin{exercise}
The second solution to the equation on the period $[-\pi, \pi]$ is given by $\answer{-\arccos\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)}$. 

\begin{exercise}
A list of all solutions is $-\arccos\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) + \answer{2\pi k}$ and $\arccos\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) + \answer{2 \pi k}$ for all integers $k$.
