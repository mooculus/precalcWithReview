\section{Introduction}
Dabin and Melina are having a walking race. Dabin can walk 1 meter per second, but Melina can walk 2 meters per second. Since Melina is the faster walker, she gives Dabin a head start of 5 meters. At this point, we can ask a few questions about the race. Two questions we'll focus on are ``When is Dabin in the lead?'' and  ``When is Melina in the lead?'' both of which can be answered by considering inequalities. 

To start, let's define some relevant functions. The function $D$ defined by $D(t) = 5 + t$ represents how far (in meters) Dabin has walked $t$ seconds after the start of the race. Similarly, the function $M$ defined by $M(t) = 2t$ represents how far Melina has walked $t$ seconds after the start of the race. In our framework, asking when Dabin is in the lead is the same as asking for all $t$ such that $D(t) > M(t)$. In the vocabulary that we'll use, we want to solve the inequality $D(t) > M(t)$. 

\begin{definition}
Say $f$ and $g$ are functions. A \index{solution ! to an inequality}\dfn{solution} to the inequality $f(x) < g(x)$ is the set of $x$ values where $f(x) < g(x)$. Similarly, a solution to the inequality $f(x) > g(x)$ is the set of $x$ values where $f(x) > g(x)$.
\end{definition}

Note that we define a solution to an inequality as a set. We will often write the sets in interval notation.

\section{Solving inequalities graphically}
\begin{example}
Let $D$ be defined by $D(t) = 5 + t$, and $M$ be defined by $M(t) = 2t$. Find a solution to the inequality $D(t) < M(t)$. 
\end{example}
\begin{explanation}
This example asks us to find the set of $t$ values where $D(t) < M(t)$. One approach to inequalities of this form is to look at the graphs of the equations involved. The following figure shows the graphs of $y = D(t)$ and $y = M(t)$. 

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[xlabel=$t$,xmin=-1, xmax=10, ymin=-1, ymax=13, xtick={0, 1,..., 10},ytick={0, 1,..., 13}]
         \addplot[dashed, domain=-1:8, <->]{5 + x} node{};
	\addplot[domain=-0.5:6.5, <->]{2*x} node{}; 
	\node (d) at (axis cs:1.5,8) {$y=D(t)$};
	\node (m) at (axis cs:3.5,4) {$y=M(t)$};
	\addplot[penColor, mark=*, only marks] coordinates {(5, 10)};
	\node[left] (l) at (axis cs:5,10.2) {$(5, 10)$};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

Because of the way we draw the graphs of functions, if $D(x) < M(x)$ for some $x$ if and only if the graph of $D$ lies below the graph of $M$ at the point $x$. Using this information, we can see that if $t > 5$, then the graph of $D$ lies below the graph of $M$. Therefore, the set of all $t$ such that $t > 5$ is the solution to $D(t) < M(t)$. Writing this in interval notation, the solution is $(5, \infty)$. 

Putting this in terms of the scenario described at the beginning of the section, Melinda is in the lead after 5 seconds. 
\end{explanation}

\begin{exploration}
Find a solution to the inequality $D(t) < M(t)$. 
\end{exploration}

\begin{example}
Let $f$ and $g$ be functions whose graphs are shown below. Assume all important behavior of the functions is shown in the figure.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[xmin=-3, xmax=3, ymin=-3, ymax=5, xtick={-2,1,..., 2},ytick={-2, -1,...,4}]
         \addplot[thick, domain=0:3, ->]{4-2*x} node{};
	\addplot[thick, domain=-3:0, <-]{4+2*x} node{};
	\addplot[domain=-1.55:1.55, <->, dashed]{2*x^2} node{}; 
	\node (g) at (axis cs:2,4) {$y=g(x)$};
	\node (f) at (axis cs:-1.5,-1) {$y=f(x)$};
	\addplot[penColor, mark=*, only marks] coordinates {(-1,2)};
	\addplot[penColor, mark=*, only marks] coordinates {(1,2)};
	\node[left] (l) at (axis cs:-1,2) {$(-1, 2)$};
	\node[right] (r) at (axis cs:1,2) {$(1,2)$};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Solve the inequality $f(x) < g(x)$.
	\item Solve the inequality $f(x) \ge g(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}


\begin{explanation}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  To solve $f(x) < g(x)$, we look for where the graph of $f$ is below the graph of $g$. This appears to happen for the $x$ values less than $-1$ and greater than $1$. Our solution is $(-\infty, -1) \cup (1,\infty)$.

	\item To solve $f(x) \geq g(x)$, we look for solutions to $f(x)=g(x)$ as well as $f(x) > g(x)$. To solve the former equation we can look at the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points. This yields $x = \pm 1$. To solve $f(x) > g(x)$, we look for where the graph of $f$ is above the graph of $g$.  This appears to happen between $x=-1$ and $x=1$, on the interval $(-1,1)$. Hence, our solution to $f(x) \geq g(x)$ is $[-1,1]$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{explanation}

Now let's turn our attention to inequalities involving absolute values, which are often a source of confusion. The following theorem provides the complete story.

\begin{theorem}
Let $c$ be a real number.
\begin{itemize}

\item  For $c > 0$, $|x| < c$ is equivalent to $-c<x<c$.

\item  For $c > 0$, $|x| \leq c$ is equivalent to $-c \leq x \leq c$.

\item  For $c \leq 0$, $|x| < c$ has no solution, and for $c < 0$, $|x| \leq c$ has no solution.

\item  For $c \geq 0$, $|x| > c$ is equivalent to $x<-c$ or $x>c$.

\item  For $c \geq 0$, $|x| \geq c$ is equivalent to $x \leq -c$ or $x \geq c$.

\item  For $c < 0$, $|x| > c$ and $|x| \geq c$ are true for all real numbers.

\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

In light of what we have developed in this section, we can understand these statements graphically. For instance, if $c > 0$, the graph of $y=c$ is a horizontal line which lies above the $x$-axis through $(0,c)$. To solve $|x| < c$, we are looking for the $x$ values where the graph of $y=|x|$ is below the graph of $y=c$. We know that the graphs intersect when $|x|=c$, which we know happens when $x=c$ or $x=-c$.  Graphing, we get

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[axis equal image, ymin=-1, ymax=7,ticks=none]
         \addplot[thick, domain=0:7, ->]{x} node{};
	\addplot[thick, domain=-7:0, <-]{(-1)*x} node{};
	\addplot[<->, dashed]{5} node{}; 
	\node (g) at (axis cs:3,5.5) {$y=c$};
	\node (f) at (axis cs:2,0.5) {$y=|x|$};
	\addplot[penColor, mark=*, only marks] coordinates {(5,5)};
	\addplot[penColor, mark=*, only marks] coordinates {(-5,5)};
	\node[left] (l) at (axis cs:-5,4.5) {$(-c,c)$};
	\node[right] (r) at (axis cs:5,4.5) {$(c,c)$};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

We see that the graph of $y=|x|$ is below $y=c$ for $x$ between $-c$ and $c$, and hence we get $|x| < c$ is equivalent to $-c < x < c$. The other properties in the theorem can be shown similarly. You can try changing the value of $c$ using Desmos.

\begin{example}
Solve the inequality $4 - 3|2x + 1| > -2$.
\end{example}
\begin{explanation}
Let's start by graphing both sides of the inequality on the same axes. 
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[xmin=-3,xmax=3,ymin=-5, ymax=5,xtick={-2,-1,...,2},ytick={-4,-3,...,4}]
         \addplot[thick, domain=-0.5:1, ->]{(-6)*x + 1} node{};
	\addplot[thick, domain=-2:-0.5, <-]{6*x + 7} node{};
	\addplot[domain=-3:3,<->, dashed]{-2} node{}; 
	\node (g) at (axis cs:2,-1.5) {$y = -2$};
	\node (f) at (axis cs:-1.75,3) {$y=4 - 3|2x + 1|$};
	\addplot[penColor, mark=*, only marks] coordinates {(0.5,-2)};
	\addplot[penColor, mark=*, only marks] coordinates {(-1.5,-2)};
	\node[left] (l) at (axis cs:-1.75,-3) {$\left(-\frac{3}{2}, -2\right)$};
	\node[right] (r) at (axis cs:0.75,-3) {$\left(\frac{1}{2}, -2\right)$};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

We see that the graph of $y=4-3|2x+1|$ is above $y=-2$ for $x$ values between $-\frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the solution in interval notation is $\left(-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$.
\end{explanation}

\begin{example}
Solve the inequality $x^2 \le x$.
\end{example}
\begin{explanation}
We could start by graphing both sides of the inequality on the same graph, but here, we'll demonstrate another possible approach. Note that $x^2 \le x$ is equivalent to the inequality $x^2 - x \le 0$, by subtracting $x$ from both sides. Now, let's graph $y = x^2 - x$ and $y = 0$ on the same axes.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[xmin=-3, xmax=4]
         \addplot[domain=-2.2:3.2, <->]{x^2 - x} node{};
	\addplot[<->, dashed, very thick]{0} node{}; 
	\node (g) at (axis cs:2,6) {$y=x^2 - x$};
	\node (f) at (axis cs:-2,0.5) {$y=0$};
	\addplot[penColor, mark=*, only marks] coordinates {(0,0)};
	\addplot[penColor, mark=*, only marks] coordinates {(1,0)};
	\node(l) at (axis cs:-.5,-1) {$(0,0)$};
	\node(r) at (axis cs:1,-1) {$(1,0)$};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

Notice that the two points of intersection are $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$, so $x^2 - x = 0$ for $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. To find the solution to $x^2 - x < 0$, we can see that the graph of $y = x^2 - x$ lies below the graph of $y = 0$ between 0 and 1. Therefore, the solution is $[0, 1]$. 
\end{explanation}

The above example illustrates a common technique. Rather than considering two functions $f$ and $g$ and asking when one is greater than, less than, or equal to the other, we can move one function to the other side, and consider the function $f - g$. Now, the problem becomes one of finding when the function $f - g$ is positive, negative, or zero.
