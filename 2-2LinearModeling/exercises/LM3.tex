Your friend buys a new car, and as soon as they drive it off the lot, it begins to depreciate in value. After 2 years, the car is worth \$$16,000$ and after 4 years, the car is worth \$$12,000$. Assume that the car's value drops linearly. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a linear equation that expresses the value of the car $V$ in terms of
the number of years $x$ since it was purchased is $V = \answer{-2000x + 20000}$. 

\item The $V$-intercept (or $y$-intercept) of the linear model is $(\answer{0},\answer{20000})$. \\
Note: Due to the common use of $x$ for the input variable and $y$ for the output variable, we sometimes says $x$-intercept for the input value when the output is 0 and $y$-intercept for the output value when the input is 0, even when the input and output are represented by letters other than $x$ and $y$ such as in this problem.

\item The $V$-value of the $V$-intercept represents
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{the starting value of the car.}
\choice{the time at which the car's value is 0.}
\choice{the average value of the car over its lifespan.}
\end{multipleChoice}

\item The $x$-intercept of the linear model is $(\answer{10}, \answer{0})$.

\item The $x$-value of the $x$-intercept represents
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{the starting value of the car.}
\choice[correct]{the time at which the car's value is 0.}
\choice{the average value of the car over its lifespan.}
\end{multipleChoice}
