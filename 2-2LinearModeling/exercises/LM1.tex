A landscaping company charges \$45 per cubic yard of mulch plus a delivery charge of \$20.


\begin{enumerate}
\item A linear function which computes the total cost $C$ (in dollars) to deliver $x$ cubic yards of mulch is given by $C = \answer{45x + 20}$.

\item According to the linear function above, 20 cubic yards of mulch costs \$$\answer{920}$.

\item According to the linear function above, \$560 will buy you $\answer{12}$ cubic yards of mulch. 

\item According to the linear function above, \$300 will buy you $\answer{\frac{280}{45}}$ cubic yards of mulch.
