\begin{exercise}

You and your friend decide to have a bike race. Your speed is 16 kilometers per hour, and your friend's is 20 kilometers per hour. Your friend is faster than you are, so they give you a head start of 2 kilometers.

We are going to find a linear model expressing the distance (in kilometers) you travel (represented by $f$) and a linear model expressing the distance (in kilometers) your friend travels (represented by $g$). Both linear models will have time since the race began as the input value (represented by $x$).

\begin{enumerate}
\item One of the following graphs represents the linear model of your position and the other graph represents the linear model of your friend's position.


\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[title={Graph $A$},xmin=-1,xmax=3,ymin=-1,ymax=50,minor xtick=,
minor ytick=,xtick={0,.5,...,3},ytick={0,10,...,50}]
        \addplot{20*x} node{Graph $A$};
    \end{axis}
    
\end{tikzpicture}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[title={Graph $B$},xmin=-1,xmax=3,ymin=-1,ymax=50,minor xtick=,
minor ytick=,xtick={0,.5,...,3},ytick={0,10,...,50}]
        \addplot{16*x + 2} node{Graph $B$};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}


The graph representing your position is
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Graph $A$.}
\choice[correct]{Graph $B$.}
\end{multipleChoice}


\item A linear equation for the distance you travel is $f = \answer{16x + 2}$.

\item A linear equation for the distance your friend travels is $g = \answer{20x}$.

\item If the race is 5 kilometers long, who will win?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{You}
\choice{Your friend}
\choice{It will be a tie}
\end{multipleChoice}

\item If the race is 10 kilometers long, who will win?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{You}
\choice{Your friend}
\choice[correct]{It will be a tie}
\end{multipleChoice}

\item If the race is 20 kilometers long, who will win?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{You}
\choice[correct]{Your friend}
\choice{It will be a tie}
\end{multipleChoice}
