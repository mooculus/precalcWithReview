\begin{exercise}
Consider the relation with points of the form $(x, y)$, where $x$ represents a distance given in miles, and $y$ represents the same distance in feet. For example, $(1, 5280)$ is in the relation. 

Fill in the following table with the correct values of the relation:

\[
 \begin{array}{||c c||} 
 \hline
 \text{Distance in Miles} & \text{Distance in Feet} \\
 \hline\hline
 0 & \answer{0}\\ 
 \hline
 \answer{1} & 5280 \\
 \hline
 3 & \answer{15840}\\
 \hline
 6 & \answer{31680} \\
 \hline
 \answer{10} & 52800 \\ 
 \hline
\end{array}
\]
