In a laboratory, there is a culture with $340$ bacteria. Let's say that $t$ hours after the initial observation, the population of bacteria is $P(t)$, and that it grows at a rate of $15\%$ per hour. What is the amount of bacteria we have in the culture after three and a half hours? Round your answer to the nearest integer. $P(3.5)\cong \answer{555}$
