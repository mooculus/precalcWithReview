In a laboratory, there is a culture with $340$ bacteria. Let's say that $t$ hours after the initial observation, the population of bacteria is $P(t)$, and that it grows at a rate of $15\%$ per hour. What is the amount of bacteria we have in the culture after three and a half hours? 
Enter the exact answer in calculator ready format.  $P(3.5)=\answer{340(1.15)^{3.5}}$
Use a calculator to round your answer to the nearest integer. $P(3.5)\cong \answer{555} \calcHW$
