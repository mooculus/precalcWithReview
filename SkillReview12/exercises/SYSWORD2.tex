\begin{exercise}
There are 30 people at a party. At this party there are 4 more men than women. Using a system of equations set up two equations to help you figure out how many men and women are at this party. Let $m$ represent men and $w$ represent women.

\[
\begin{cases}
\text{Formula comparing men and women} m=\answer{w+4}\\
\text{Formula for total people at the party} \answer{m+w}=30
\end{cases}
\]
Use the previous equations and solve for the number of men and women.
\[
m = \answer{17} \text{men}
\]
\[
w = \answer{13} \text {women}
\]
\end{exercise}
