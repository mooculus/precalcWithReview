\begin{exercise}
Steven is preparing dog food for his dog. He wants to feed his dog $18$ ounces of food containing $24\%$ protein, but neither of the two types of dog food he has have that percentage. He has a lamb based dog food with $22\%$ protein and a beef based dog food with $28\%$ protein. Using a system of equations set up two equations to help you figure out how much of each food Steven needs to mix. Let $L$ represent the lamb based food and $B$ represent the beef based food.

\[
\begin{cases}
\text{Formula for total ounces of food} \answer{1}L + \answer{1}B = \answer{18}\\
\text{Formula for protein in the food} \answer{.22}L+\answer{.28}B=\answer{4.32}
\end{cases}
\]
Use the previous equations and solve for the ounces of lamb and beef.
\[
L = \answer{12} \text{ounces of lamb}
\]
\[
B = \answer{6} \text {ounces of beef}
\]
\end{exercise}
