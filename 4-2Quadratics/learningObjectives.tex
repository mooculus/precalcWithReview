\begin{objectives}

\item Definition of Quadratics
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is a quadratic function?  
	\item What does the graph of a quadratic function look like?
	\item Recognize a quadratic in standard form
	\item Become familiar with standard vocabulary about quadratic functions.
\end{itemize}

\item Vertex Form
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the vertex form of a quadratic?
	\item Use completing the square to convert a quadratic in standard form to a quadratic in vertex form.
	\item Recognize a quadratic in standard form
	\item Become familiar with standard vocabulary about quadratic functions.
\end{itemize}

\item Factored Form
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is Factored Form or Root Form of a quadratic?  How is it the same or different from saying a quadratic is factored?
	\item Use factoring to convert quadratics from standard form to Factored Form.
	\item Use Factored Form to find the roots of a quadratic
	\item Use the Quadratic Formula to find the roots of a quadratic and/or to write the quadratic in Factored Form
\end{itemize}
