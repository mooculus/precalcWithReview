In this problem, we will step through the process of solving the following system of three equations with three variables. 

$$
\begin{cases}
4x + y + z & = 5 \\
x - 2y + 6z & = 30 \\
x + z & = 5
\end{cases}
$$

\begin{exercise}
Our strategy is to eliminate one of the variables. Since the third equation does not contain a $y$, we try to eliminate $y$ from the other two equations. To eliminate $y$, we can multiply the top equation by $\answer{2}$.

\begin{exercise}
After we do this, our system becomes 
$$
\begin{cases} 
\answer{8}x + 2y + \answer{2}z & = \answer{10}\\
x - 2y + 6z & = 30 \\
x + z & = 5
\end{cases}
$$
\begin{exercise}
After adding the top two equations above, we obtain the equation $\answer{9}x + \answer{8}z = \answer{40}$. 

\begin{exercise}
Now we have two equations whose only variables are $x$ and $z$:
$$\begin{cases}
9x + 8z & = 40\\
x + z & = 5.
\end{cases}$$
A solution to this system of equations is $x = \answer{0}$ and $z = \answer{5}$. Use any technique you'd like to solve the system. 
\begin{exercise}
Plugging into the first equation from our original system, we have
$$
4(0) + y + (5) = 5,
$$
so $y = \answer{0}$. This, along with your earlier values for $x$ and $z$, gives a solution to the original system of equations.
