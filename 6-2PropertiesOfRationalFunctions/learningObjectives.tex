\begin{objectives}

\item End Behavior of Rational Functions
\begin{itemize}
	\item When do rational functions have horizontal asymptotes?
	\item Are there other kinds of asymptotes for rational functions?
	\item How does one find the end behavior and asymptotes of rational functions?
\end{itemize}

\item Zeros of Rational Functions
\begin{itemize}
\item Finding $x$-intercepts of Rational Functions
\item Realizing the importance of considering the domain of a rational function when finding the zeros
\end{itemize}


\item Graphing Rational Functions
\begin{itemize}
	\item What does the graph of a rational function look like near the points which are not in the domain?
	\item How does one determine if a rational function has any vertical asymptotes?  How does one find them?
	\item How does one determine if the graph of a rational function has any holes?  How does one find them?
	\item How do we put all the information we know about a rational function together to draw the graph?
\end{itemize}
