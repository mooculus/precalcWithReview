Jayson is paving his driveway and hires a contractor to do the job. The contractor charges \$15 per square foot. Say Jayson's driveway is a rectangle with a perimeter of 110 feet, and the job costs \$11,160. Then, the longer side of Jayson's driveway is $\answer{31}$ feet long and the shorter side is $\answer{24}$ feet long.
