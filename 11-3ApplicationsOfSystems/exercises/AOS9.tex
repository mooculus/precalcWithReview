\begin{exercise}
Eunice cuts a 20 inch long piece of wire into two pieces. She bends one piece into an equilateral triangle and the other into a square. The total combined area of the two shapes is $4(1 + \sqrt{3})$ inches$^2$. If the length of each piece is a whole number, then the perimeter of the triangle is $\answer{12}$ inches, and the perimeter of the square is $\answer{8}$ inches.
