\begin{exercise}
Eunice cuts a 20 inch long piece of wire into two pieces. She bends both pieces into squares, but not necessarily identical squares. The total combined area of the two squares is $17$ inches$^2$. If the length of each piece is a whole number, then the perimeter of the smaller square is $\answer{4}$ inches, and the perimeter of the larger square is $\answer{16}$ inches.
