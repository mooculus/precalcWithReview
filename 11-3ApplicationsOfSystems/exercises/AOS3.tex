Systems of nonlinear equations show up in third semester Calculus in the midst of some really cool problems. The system below came from a problem which asked to find the dimensions of a rectangular box with a volume of 1000 cubic inches that has minimal surface area. The variables $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the dimensions of the box and $\lambda$ is called a Lagrange multiplier. Solve the system. If $\lambda$ bothers you, change it to $w$ in the system.

$$	\begin{cases}
		2y + 2z &= \lambda yz\\
		2x + 2z &= \lambda xz\\
		2y + 2x &= \lambda xy\\
		xyz & = 1000
	\end{cases}	$$

\begin{align*}
x & = \answer{10} \\
y & = \answer{10} \\
z & = \answer{10} \\
\lambda & = \answer{\frac{2}{5}}
\end{align*}
