\begin{exercise}
On a calm day, a photographer is filming a hot air balloon.  When the balloon launches, the photographer is stationed 850 feet away from the balloon.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item When the balloon is 200 feet off the ground, what is the angle of elevation of the camera?
%
\item When the balloon is 275 feet off the ground, what is the angle of elevation of the camera?
%
\item Let $\theta$ represent the camera's angle of elevation when the balloon is at an arbitrary height $h$ above the ground.  Express $\theta$ as a function of $h$.
%
\item Determine $AV_{[200,275]}$ for $\theta$ (as a function of $h$) and write at least one sentence to carefully explain the meaning of the value you find, including units.

\end{enumerate}
