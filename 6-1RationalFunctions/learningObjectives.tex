\begin{objectives}

\item The Famous Function $f(x)=1/x$
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduce 1/x as a famous function, examine its properties 
	\item Composing 1/x with other functions (introduce secant, cosecant, and cotangent) 
\end{itemize}

\item Definition of Rational Functions
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is a rational function?
	\item How can one find the domain of a rational function? 
	\item How can one identify if a function is a rational function?
%	\item What is an asymptotes?  When and why does it occur?
%	\item Properties of rational functions
%	\item Examine the end behavior of rational functions
\end{itemize}

\item Polynomial Long Division
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce long division of polynomials
\item Understand quotient and remainder in this setting
\item Investigate the relationsships between the degree of the numerator and denominator of a rational function and the resulting degrees after long division
\end{itemize}
