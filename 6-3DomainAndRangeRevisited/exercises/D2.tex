\begin{exercise}
  A box with an open top is to be constructed from a rectangular piece
  of cardboard with dimensions $12\unit{cm}$ by $20\unit{cm}$ by
  cutting out equal squares of side $x$ at each corner and then folding
  up the sides:
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw [dashed] (0,0) rectangle (1,1);
      \draw [dashed] (6,0) rectangle (7,1);
      \draw [dashed] (6,4) rectangle (7,5);
      \draw [dashed] (0,4) rectangle (1,5);

      \draw [penColor, very thick, fill=fill3] (0,1) rectangle (1,4);
      \draw [penColor, very thick, fill=fill3] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);
      \draw [penColor, very thick, fill=fill3] (1,4) rectangle (6,5);
      \draw [penColor, very thick, fill=fill3] (6,1) rectangle (7,4);
      
      \draw [penColor,very thick,fill=fill1] (1,1) rectangle (6,4);

      \draw[decoration={brace,mirror,raise=.2cm},decorate,thin] (0,0)--(7,0);
      \draw[decoration={brace,raise=.2cm},decorate,thin] (0,0)--(0,5);
      
      \node [penColor] at (3.5,-.5) {$20$};
      \node [penColor] at (-.5,2.5) {$12$};

      \draw[decoration={brace,mirror,raise=.2cm},decorate,thin] (7,4)--(7,5);
      \draw[decoration={brace,raise=.2cm},decorate,thin] (6,5)--(7,5);
      
      \node [penColor] at (7.5,4.5) {$x$};
      \node [penColor] at (6.5,5.5) {$x$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  Express the volume $V$ of the box as a function of $x$.  (In factored form)
  $$
  V(x) = \answer{x(20-2x)(12-2x)}
  $$
  \begin{feedback}
  	When folded up, what is the width of the box in terms of $x$?  The length?  The height?
  \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
  Multiply out your answer above:
  $$
  V(x) = \answer{4}x^3 + \answer{-64}x^2 + \answer{240}x
  $$

\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
  If $x$ increases in value from $1$ to $(1+h)$, by how much will volume of the box change? Simplify.
  $$
  V(1+h) - V(1) = \answer{4}h^3 +\answer{-52}h^2 + \answer{124}h
  $$
\end{exercise}
\begin{hint}
	You found $V(x)$ above.  Plug in $x=1+h$ and $x=1$, then subtract and simplify.
\end{hint}
