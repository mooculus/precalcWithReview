Chicago's average monthly rainfall, $R=R(t)$ inches, is given as a function of the month, $t$, where January is $t=1$, in the table below.


$$
\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c}
\hline t \text{, month} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8\\
\hline R \text{, inches} & 1.8 & 1.8 & 2.7 & 3.1 & 3.5 & 3.7 & 3.5 & 3.4\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$


\begin{exercise}
Solve $R(t)=3.4$
$$t=\answer{8}$$
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The solution(s) to $R(t)=3.4$ can be interpreted as saying
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Chicago's average rainfall is least in the month of August.}
\choice[correct]{Chicago's average rainfall in the month of August is 3.4 inches.}
\choice{Chicago's average rainfall increases by 3.4 inches in the month of May.}
\choice{Chicago's average rainfall is greatest in the month of May.}
\choice{None of the above}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Solve $R(t)=R(5)$.

How many solutions are there? $$\answer{2}$$
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Enter the $t$-values where $R(t)=R(5)$ in the boxes from smallest to larget values.

$$t=\answer{5}$$
$$t=\answer{7}$$
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The solution(s) to $R(t)=R(5)$ can be interpreted as saying
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Chicago's average rainfall is greatest in the month of May.}
\choice[correct]{Chicago's average rainfall is 3.5 inches in the months of May and July.}
\choice{Chicago's average rainfall is 3.5 inches in the month of May.}
\choice{Chicago's average rainfall is 3.5 inches in the month of July.}
\choice{None of the above}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{exercise}
