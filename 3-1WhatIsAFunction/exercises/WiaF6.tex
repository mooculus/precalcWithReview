\begin{exercise}

An open box is to be made from a flat piece of material 20 inches long and 6 inches wide by cutting equal squares of length $x$ from the corners and folding up the sides.

Write the volume $V$ of the box as a function of $x$. Leave it as a product of factors, do not multiply out the factors.

$$V=\answer{(20-2x)(6-2x)x}$$

What is the smallest $x$-value $a$ that the box can have?

$$a=\answer{0}$$

and what is the largest $x$-value $b$ that the box can have?

$$b=\answer{3}$$
