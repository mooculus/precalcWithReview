  At its current rate of growth, the population of the United States will double in $115.87$ years.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
  \item If $P_0$ is the initial population of the United States, write a formula for the population as a function of time $t$ in years. Answer: $P(t) = P_0 \cdot 2^{\answer{t/115.87}}$.
  \item What is the annual percent growth of the population? Approximate to one decimal place. Answer: $\answer{0.6}\%$. {\bf Hint:} Recall that the growth rate $r$ of an exponential function of the form $ab^t+c$ is $r$, where $b=1+r$.
  \end{enumerate}
