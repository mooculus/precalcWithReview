  Doctors use radiactive iodine to help diagnose some thyroid disorders. This isodine isotope decays according to the function $a(t) = 26e^{-0.087t}$, where $a(t)$ is the amount of iodine remaining in grams after $t$ days.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the amount of radioactive iodine originally present. Answer: $\answer{26}$ grams.
  \item How much radioactive iodine is left after $30$ days? Round your answer to two decimal places. Answer: $\answer{1.91}$\calcHW grams.
  \item How long will it take for half of the original iodine to remain? Round your answer up to the next integer. Answer: $\answer{8}$\calcHW days.
  \end{enumerate}
