\begin{exercise}

Melinda grows a unique type of mango known for its sweetness and smoothness. Because of this, the price of a mango increases with the distance from Melinda's farm. The function $M$ gives the price of a mango in dollars given the distance $x$ in miles from Melinda's farm:
$$
M(x) = \frac{1}{100}x^2 + 4
$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $\av_{[1, 10]}$.

$\av_{[1, 10]} = \$\answer{0.11}$ per mile from Melinda's farm.  

\item Compute $\av_{[200, 300]}$.

$\av_{[200, 300]} = \$\answer{5}$ per mile from Melinda's farm.

	
\end{enumerate}
