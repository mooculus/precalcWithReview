\end{itemize}\end{motivatingQuestions}


%Recall in Section 3-2-3 that we briefly discussed the square root function..

%Pulling from Elizabeth's lecture notes:

A {\em root} function is the inverse function of a polynomial of the form $p(x)=x^n$, written $r(x)=\sqrt[n]{x}$. There are two types of root functions: {\em even} roots (where $n$ is even) and {\em odd} roots (where $n$ is odd). In both cases, we have

$$\underbrace{\sqrt[n]{x} \cdot \sqrt[n]{x} \cdot \sqrt[n]{x} \cdot \sqrt[n]{x} \cdots \sqrt[n]{x}}_n =x.$$

%%%%%%%%%%%%ODD ROOTS
\section{Odd Roots}

Recall that every polynomial $p(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is odd, has the same basic shape. This is demonstrated in the figure below by the graphs of $y = x^n$ for $n = 3, 5,7,9$.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
     \begin{axis}[
                domain=-4:4, ymax=15, xmax=5, ymin=-15, xmin=-5,
                axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=${y}$,
                ytick={-14,-10,-6,-2,2,6,10,14},
                xtick={-4,-2,2,4},

    \end{axis}

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

Now, are these functions invertible? Looking at the graphs, we see that these functions pass the horizontal line test, i.e., each value of $y$ occurs only once. Thus, the functions are one-to-one, and therefore invertible.

Let's delve more deeply into the $p(x) = x^3$ example. We have now established that it is invertible, and it's inverse is $r(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$. 

\begin{exploration}
Draw both functions on the axes provided, then answer the following questions about the function $r(x)$.

                domain=-4:4, ymax=9, xmax=9, ymin=-9, xmin=-9,

\begin{example}
Below, we have an example of the graph of $y=x^5$ and the two functions

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
     \begin{axis}[
                domain=-4:4, ymax=6, xmax=6, ymin=-6, xmin=-6,

          \addplot [draw=purple, samples=200,thick, smooth, domain=(0:6)] {x^(1/5)};
            \addplot [draw=purple, samples=400, thick, smooth, domain=(-6:0)] {-(-x)^(1/5)};
        %   \addplot [draw=orange, thick, smooth, domain=(-1.4:1.4)] {x^9};

       \addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,samples=100,domain=(-6:6)] {x};
        %\addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,samples=100,domain=(-9:4)] ({x},{2});
    \end{axis}

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

\end{example}

Recall that a function $f$ is {\em even} if $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain, and $f$ is {\em odd} if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$. Otherwise, the function is neither. % Recall that these properties are reflected in the graph of the function. An even function is reflected across a single axis, while an odd function is reflected across both.
Let's consider an example. Given $x=8$, $r(x) = \sqrt[3]{8}=2$ and $r(-x) = \sqrt[3]{-8} = -2$, since $(-2)\cdot(-2)\cdot(-2) =(4)\cdot(-2) = -8$. Based on this example, do you think $r(x)$ is even, odd, or neither?

If you guessed odd, then you are correct! All odd root functions are odd functions. We can show this through the associativity and commutativity of multiplication. 
Consider $r(x) = \sqrt[n]{x} = y$ for $n$ odd, then we know that $\underbrace{y \cdot y \cdot y \cdots y}_n=x$, so
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{(-y) \cdot (-y) \cdot (-y) \cdots (-y)}_n 
&= \underbrace{(-1) \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1) \cdots (-1)}_n \cdot \underbrace{y \cdot y \cdot y \cdots y}_n \\
&= (-1) \cdot x = -x.
\end{align*}
Thus, $r(-x) = \sqrt[n]{-x} = -y = -\sqrt[n]{x} = -r(x)$, meaning $r$ is an odd function.
It is important to note that the parentheses around the ``-1" terms are {\bf not} optional. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%EVEN ROOTS
\section{Even Roots}
We again begin by recalling the general shape of $p(x) = x^n$, but this time for $n$ {\em even}. These functions also have the same basic shape for all even $n$. This is demonstrated by the graphs of $y = x^n$ for $n = 2,4,6,8$ given below.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
     \begin{axis}[
                domain=-4:4, ymax=7, xmax=5, ymin=-2, xmin=-5,
                axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=${y}$,
                ytick={-1,1,2,3,4,5,6},

        \addplot [draw=black, thick, smooth, domain=(-2.8:2.8)] {x^2};
         \addplot [draw=blue, thick, smooth, domain=(-1.8:1.8)] {x^4};
          \addplot [draw=purple, thick, smooth, domain=(-1.5:1.5)] {x^6};
           \addplot [draw=orange, thick, smooth, domain=(-1.4:1.4)] {x^8};
           
           
         %  \node[label = right:{$y=x^2$}] at (5,4) {};

     %   \addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,samples=100,domain=(-9:9)] ({3},{x});
        %\addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,samples=100,domain=(-9:4)] ({x},{2});

    \end{axis}

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

To see more of how these graphs change with $n$, follow the
\desmos{qpqwtrppqt}{800}{600}.

Now, are these functions invertible? All of the graphs in the figure above are symmetric about the $y$-axis (example $2^2 = 4 = (-2)^2$), so they do {\em not} pass the horizontal line test. Thus, these functions are {\em not} one-to-one, and therefore {\em not} invertible.

So, how do we define an even root function?

Let's start with $n=2$. Consider the polynomial $p(x)=x^2$, graphed below with its ``inverse." 
% to the polynomial $p(x) = x^2$. Observing the graph below, we see that by restricting the domain of $p$ to $x \geq 0$, we now have a function which passes the horizontal line test, and can thus be inverted.
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
     \begin{axis}[
                domain=-4:4, ymax=8, xmax=8, ymin=-4, xmin=-4,
                axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=${y}$,
               ytick={-2,2,4, 6},
                xtick={-2,2,4,6},
                ticklabel style={font=\scriptsize}
                ]
        
        %\addplot [draw=penColor, very thick, smooth, domain=(-7.5:3), <->] {1/(x-3) + 2};
       % \addplot [draw=black, thick, smooth, domain=(-2.5:2.5)] {x^3};
         \addplot [draw=black, thick, smooth, domain=(-3:3)] {x^2};
          \addplot [draw=purple, samples=200,thick, smooth, domain=(0:8)] {x^(1/2)};
            \addplot [draw=purple, samples=200, thick, smooth, domain=(0:8)] {-x^(1/2)};
        %   \addplot [draw=orange, thick, smooth, domain=(-1.4:1.4)] {x^9};

       \addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,samples=100,domain=(-6:8)] {x};
        %\addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,samples=100,domain=(-9:4)] ({x},{2});
    \end{axis}

\end{tikzpicture}

Observe that by restricting the domain of $p$ to $x \geq 0$, we now have a function which passes the horizontal line test, and can thus be inverted.

The relation to find this inverse is $x=y^2$, but the function will be $y = \sqrt{x}$. Specifically, we let $p(x) = x^2$ for $x \geq 0$, then define $r(x) = \sqrt[2]{x} = \sqrt{x}$ as the inverse function of $p(x)$ on this restricted domain.

\begin{exploration}
We now repeat Exploration 1 for $r(x) = \sqrt[4]{x}$. Draw both functions on the axes provided, then answer the following questions about the function $r(x)$.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
     \begin{axis}[
                 domain=-4:4, ymax=7, xmax=5, ymin=-2, xmin=-5,

                ]

\wordChoice{\choice{yes}\choice[correct]{no}}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}

Now, what if we instead restricted our domain to $x \leq 0$? Consider $q(x) = x^2$ defined for $x \leq 0$, the inverse of this function is $s(x) = -\sqrt{x} = -r(x)$.

Hence, if we wish to find all values that undo $y=x^2$, then we must consider both $y = \sqrt{x}$ and $y=-\sqrt{x}$. It is important to note that this is true for {\em all} even roots. 
We can show this in the same way that we showed odd root functions are odd functions. 
Consider $r(x) = \sqrt[n]{x} = y$ for $n$ even, then we know that $\underbrace{y \cdot y \cdot y \cdots y}_n=x$, so
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{(-y) \cdot (-y) \cdot (-y) \cdots (-y)}_n 
&= \underbrace{(-1) \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1) \cdots (-1)}_n \cdot \underbrace{y \cdot y \cdot y \cdots y}_n \\
&= (1) \cdot x = x.,
\end{align*}
since we have $(-1)^2 = 1$ multiplied $\frac{n}{2}$ times.

%
%%This exemplifies the fact that, 
%In general, the square root is not one-to-one when used for {\em solving} equations. Instead, the output must be chosen. For instance, the square root of 9 is 3, since the square root {\em function} is only defined on $[0,\infty)$. However, if we wish to solve the equation $x^2=9$, the solution is not $x=3$, or, to be more precise, there are \textbf{two} solutions: $x=3$ \textbf{and} $x = -3$, since both $3^2$ and $(-3)^2$ are equal to 9. This can be demonstrated by solving the equation through factoring:
%$$0=x^2-9 =(x+3)(x-3),$$
%which has {\em two} solutions: $x=3$ and $x = -3$.
%
%$\sqrt{}$ is not one-to-one so you must {\em choose} which value makes sense in the context, or list both.

We now formalize the definition of the $n^{th}$ root function for a general positive integer $n$.

\begin{definition}
For any real number $x$, the $n^{th}$ root of $x$ is denoted by 
$$\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{\frac{1}{n}}.$$
%
It is further defined as the real number $y$ such that 
$$y^n = x.$$
Note that if $n$ is \textbf{even}, then both $y^n$ and $(-y)^n$ will be equal to $x$, so for this to be a {\em function}, we must choose one or the other. The {\em principal} $n^{th}$ root is the positive value, $|y|$. %since we define the $n^{th}$ root {\em function} to produce values in $[0,\infty)$ for $n$ even as with the more-common square root. 
Further note that the input of an even $n^{th}$ root (the $x$ in $\sqrt[n]{x}$) must be in $[0,\infty)$. % as well.

However, if $n$ is \textbf{odd}, then there is only one such $y$, and {\em both} the input and output of the $n^{th}$ root function are in $(-\infty,\infty)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
We demonstrate a few common even and odd $n^{th}$ roots to highlight this distinction.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$, since $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$.

\item $\sqrt[3]{-8} = - 2$, since $-2 \cdot (-2) \cdot (-2) = 4 \cdot (-2) = -8$.

\item $\sqrt[4]{16} = 2$, since $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$. However, the $4^{th}$ root of -16 is not defined.

\item $\sqrt[4]{0} =0$, since zero times any number is always zero. This is {\em the} example of an even $n^{th}$ root that has only {\em one} solution.

\item Likewise, $\sqrt[125]{0} = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

Generally speaking, we use $n^{th}$ roots to solve equations, in which case we must be careful to understand the context of application as explained above with the square root.

If we are asked to find all values $x$ such that $x^2=4$, then the question is asking which values of $x$ multiplied by themselves give 4. In other words, find $x$ such that $x \cdot x$ is equal to 4. It is simple to see that there are two values which make this true:
$$x\cdot x = 1\cdot x \cdot x = (-1)^2 \cdot x \cdot x = -1 \cdot x \cdot (-1)\cdot x = -x \cdot (-x),$$
by the distributive property of multiplication. Thus, both $x$ and $-x$ will be solutions. In solving an equation, it is common to express this as follows.
\begin{align*}
x^2 &= 4 \\
\sqrt{x^2} &= \sqrt{4} \\
\pm x &= 2,
\end{align*}
which translates to $x = \pm 2$. %This is because the square root of a number is always non-negative; {\em however}, we are looking for the value that makes this equation true, and s
Since $f(x)=x^2$ is \textbf{not} one-to-one, there are two values of $x$ which make it equal to any positive number, as demonstrated above.
%do \textbf{not} restrict the range of the $n^{th}$ root to $[0,\infty)$, but allow it to produce a negative value. In this case, the $n^{th}$ root is no longer one-to-one for even $n$.
This is summarized below.

\begin{callout}
{\bf Important Algebra Note:}\\
If $a^3=b$, then we know that $a = \sqrt[3]{b}$.

However, if $a^2 =b$, then {\bf either} $a=\sqrt{b}$ {\bf or} $a = -\sqrt{b}$.
\\

{\bf In General:}\\
For $n$ {\bf odd}, 
$$\text{ if } a^n = b, \text{ then } a=\sqrt[n]{b}.$$

For $n$ {\bf even},
$$\text{ if } a^n = b, \text{ then {\bf either} } a=\sqrt[n]{b} \textbf{ or } a = -\sqrt{b}.$$

\end{callout}

%\begin{callout}
%{\bf Warning:} Solving an equation like $x^2 = 4$ is very different than computing $\sqrt{4} = 2$. To solve the equation, one rewrites it as $x^2-4=0$, then factors it as $(x-2)(x+2) = 0$, and concludes that $x=-2$ or $x=2$. However, people often write this sloppily as $x = \pm 2$, and proceed to say {\bf wrong} things such as $\sqrt{4} = \pm 2$. Square roots are always non-negative, so $\sqrt{4}=2$ is the only correct equality. To relate this back with solving the equation $x^2=4$, one could alternatively take the square root of both sides, leading to $\sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{4}$. The square root of a square is not the original number, but its absolute value instead. This means that instead of writing the next step as $x=2$ (which would lead us to miss the solution $x=-2$), we should write $|x| = 2$. Which real numbers have absolute value equal to $2$? Just $x=2$ and $x=-2$.
%
%This is true for any {\em even} root, for instance, consider the equation $x^4 = 16$. If we take the fourth root ($\sqrt[4]{}$) of both sides, we then have $x = \pm 2$. However, if we have $x^3 = 8$, when we take the third root, we get only one solution, $x=2$. Factoring, we can see why this is the case: $x^3=8$ is equivalent to 
%$$0=x^3 - 8=(x-2)(x^2+2x+4),$$
%which has only one real solution, $x=2$.
%
%However, {\em odd} roots have the unique property that they can be applied to {\em negative} numbers. Following the pattern above, $x^2=-4$ has no real solutions since the square root is only defined for values greater or equal to zero. However, $x^3=-8$ does have a solution: $x=-2$, we can check this easily by multiplying out 
%$$(-2)^3=(-2)\cdot(-2)\cdot(-2) = 4 \cdot (-2) = -8.$$
%It is important to note that the parentheses around the ``-2" terms are {\bf not} optional.

In general, we are not able to simply invert polynomials.
However, when the polynomial is $p(x) = x^n$ for a positive {\em odd} integer $n$, the polynomial is invertible as the $n^{th}$ root function $r(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}$.

When $n$ is {\em even}, it is possible to define an inverse function $r(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}$ on a restricted domain ($[0, \infty)$ or $(-\infty,0]$). The principal $n^{th}$ root is defined as the inverse of $p(x)$ on the restricted domain $[0,\infty)$.
