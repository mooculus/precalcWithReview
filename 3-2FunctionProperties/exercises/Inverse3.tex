Suppose $f$ is a function which takes $x$ square meters as its input, and gives the cost $f(x)$ in dollars of how much paint is needed to cover a wall which is $x$ square meters in area. (Assume there are no discounts or sales.)

\begin{exercise}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the function $f$ one-to-one?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{no}
\choice[correct]{yes}
\end{multipleChoice}

\item Is the function $f$ invertible?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{no}
\choice[correct]{yes}
\end{multipleChoice}

\item Which of the following best describes $f^{-1}(x)$?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{How much $x$ square meters of paint costs}
\choice{How many liters of paint are needed to cover $x$ square meters of wall}
\choice[correct]{How much area $\$x$ of paint can cover}
\choice{How much area $x$ liters of paint can cover}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{enumerate}
