To mail a rectangular box with USPS Parcel Post, the box must satisfy the inequality ``Length $+$ Girth $\leq 130$ inches." Assuming we want to ship a rectangular box with a square face of side-length $x$. The length is the longest side of the box (not the square part). The girth is the sum of the four sides of the square ($4x$).

We are looking to maximize the volume of such a box. What type of equation would be needed to solve this?\\

\begin{exercise}
We maximize the volume with a cubic equation given by $V(x) = \answer{-4}x^3+\answer{130x^2}$.
\begin{exercise}
If we instead wanted to ship via another method where the ``Length $+$ Girth $\leq 108$ inches," what would be our new volume function for the same square-faced rectangular box?\\
We maximize the volume with a cubic equation given by $V(x) = \answer{-4}x^3+\answer{108x^2}$.
