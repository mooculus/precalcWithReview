For the following word problems, determine what type of function is needed to solve them (e.g., linear, quadratic, cubic, logarithmic, exponential, etc.) and give the function.

\item The half-life of the radioactive isotope Carbon-14 is about 5730 years.

Express the amount of Carbon-14 left from an initial $N$ milligrams
as a function of time $t$ in years.

What type of equation would be needed to solve this?\\
\wordChoice{\choice{linear}\choice{quadratic}\choice{cubic}\choice{logarithmic}\choice[correct]{exponential}}.
\begin{exercise}
The model is $A(t) = A_0e^{kt}$, where $A(0)=A_0$ the initial amount of the element, and $k<0$ is the constant of proportionality which satisfies the equation. \\
Now, find the function to represent the amount of Carbon-14, in grams, after $t$ years. \\
$A(t) = \answer{N}\answer{e}^{-t\frac{\answer{\ln(2)}}{\answer{5730}}}$
