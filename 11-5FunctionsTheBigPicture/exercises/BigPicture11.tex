\item  Iodine-131 is a commonly used radioactive isotope used to help detect how well
the thyroid is functioning. Suppose the decay of Iodine-131 follows the model $A(t) = A_0e^{kt}$,
and that the half-life of Iodine-131 is approximately 8 days. 
If 5 grams of Iodine-131 is present
initially, find a function which gives the amount of Iodine-131, $A$, in grams, $t$ days later.

What type of equation would be needed to solve this?\\
\wordChoice{\choice{linear}\choice{quadratic}\choice{cubic}\choice{logarithmic}\choice[correct]{exponential}}.
\begin{exercise}
The model is $A(t) = A_0e^{kt}$, where $A(0)=A_0$ the initial amount of the element, and $k<0$ is the constant of proportionality which satisfies the equation. \\
Now, find the function to represent the amount of Iodine-131, in grams, after $t$ days. \\
$A(t) = \answer{5}e^{-t \frac{\answer{\ln(2)}}{\answer{8}}}$
